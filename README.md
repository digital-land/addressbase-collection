# How to find the local authority for an address

[Guidance](https://digital-land.github.io/local-authority-addresses) to help people building a government or other public service determine the local authority which an individual property or premises resides.

This repository also includes [Analysis](https://digital-land.github.io/local-authority-addresses/analysis)) as a Jupyter notebook.

# Data sources

The following data sources are downloaded by the build process:

  * [ONS National Statistics Postcode Lookup (ONSNSPL)](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=name&tags=all(PRD_NSPL))
  * [ONS Postcode Directory (ONSPD)](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=name&tags=all(PRD_ONSPD))
  * [ONS UPRN Directory (UD)](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=name&tags=all(PRD_ONSUD))
  * [OS OpenUPRN](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenUPRN)

AddressBase has to be ordered and manually downloaded from the OS data portal, and a copy saved in the cache directory:

  * [OS AddressBase Premium](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/addressbase-premium)

# Methodology

AddressBase is used to find the postcode for an individual UPRN.

NSPL and ONSPD both assign a single local authority district to a postcode, the difference being [the method used](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/postcodeproducts) to relate a postcode to a local authority. ONSPD uses a geospatial method to match a central location for the postcode within the local authority district boundary, whilst NSPL ensures statistics are consistent in their geographical hierarchy.

# Building the guidance and report

We recommend working in [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) before installing the python dependencies:

    $ make init
    $ make
